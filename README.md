# Calculator
Hewlett-Packard has a tradition of creating stack-based calculators. Rather than using standard algebraic notation ( 1 + 1 = ), the user would enter the values, then the operator. The calculator had an “enter” key to push each value onto a stack, then pop the stack when an operation key (e.g. “+” or “-”) was pressed.
